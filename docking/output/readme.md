**Description of files**


`YihW_affinity_mode1-3.txt`: Free Energy of binding (kcal/mol) glucose (Glu), lactose (Lac), sulforhamnose (SR), sulfoquinovosyl glycerol (SQG) or sulfoquinovose (SQ) estimated by AutoDock Vina for the long and short CsqR forms. For each computational run, data on three modes with top affinities is provided.

`energy_mode1mean_gluc.txt`: data used to create a barplot for Figure S10 (Free Energy (ΔG, kcal/mol) of binding glucose, lactose, sulfoquinovose, sulfoquinovosyl glycerol, or sulforhamnose, estimated by AutoDock Vina for the models of long and short CsqR forms. Affinity parameters of the best mode with the same docking position are averaged on five computational runs. Error bars represent mean value ± standard deviation.)

`all_log_files`: log files generated by AutoDock Vina that contain information on Free Energy of binding and RMSD values

other folders contain predicted docking modes for 5 computational runs with all models of CsqR (CsqR-l-AF, CsqR-s-AF, CsqR-s-IT open, and CsqR-s-IT compact) and ligands (Glu, SQ, SR, SQG, and Lac)
